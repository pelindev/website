The contract outlines how much the insurance company pays out for vehicle repairs and medical bills.</p>

                <h1>Understanding how it works</h1>
                <p>State minimum liability car insurance requirements outline the amount of coverage you need to drive legally. Your car insurance works by paying claims filed against you after an accident. If you cause an accident, a claim is filed to help pay to repair the other driver’s car or property, and to help pay medical bills for those you injure. If you are hit, the other driver’s liability insurance would pay to fix the damage to your vehicle and for your medical expenses. Collision coverage is optional, and pays for damage to your car regardless of who is at fault in an accident. Comprehensive coverage is also optional, and pays to replace your car if stolen, and to repair it after hail, fire, flooding, animal collisions, vandalism or falling objects cause damage to it.</p>

                <h1>Different types of car insurance come into play to protect you.</h1>
                <p>Liability insurance  is mandatory in nearly all states. It covers the cost of medical bills for those you injure and the damage you do to others’ property  and vehicles, up to the amount on your policy. Liability insurance does not cover damage to your car. Comprehensive coverage pays up to the cash value of your car to repair damage from hail, flooding, fire, falling objects and animal collisions. Collision coverage pays up to the cash value of your car to repair your car regardless of who caused the accident. Comprehensive and collision are not required, and come with a deductible, which is the amount you pay before your insurance company pays toward the bill.</p>

                <h1>Compare Multiple Quotes to Save</h1>
                <p>The price for a policy can differ by hundreds of dollars among insurance companies. That’s why comparing car insurance quotes from multiple companies is one of the most effective ways to save money. If you don’t shop around, you won’t know what the cheapest price is for the coverage you want. You should compare quotes from at least three companies, and at least once a year, for the same amount of coverage to be sure you’re getting the most affordable rate for your driver profile.</p>

                <h1>Buying insurance safeguards you from financial ruin should you have an accident.</h1>
                <p>If you have an accident and don’t have insurance, you will have to pay for all of the expenses out of pocket. Even minor accidents can cause thousands of dollars in damage. Major accidents with multiple injuries could bankrupt you without the safety net of insurance coverage. Additionally, you must have car insurance to drive legally in nearly all states. If you are cited for driving without insurance, you will likely have to pay fees and may face penalties, such as having your license and registration suspended, or even serving time in jail.
                    Buying car insurance gives you peace of mind by paying for medical expenses and car repairs of others after you’ve caused an accident. Liability car insurance pays for the damage you cause to other vehicles and for medical expenses of those you injure. And if you are hit by a driver, that person’s liability would pay for to fix your car. Two additional types of coverage pay for damage to your own car in other circumstances. Collision pays to repair your car regardless of fault. Comprehensive pays to replace your car if stolen and to repair you car’s damage from hail, fire, flooding, vandalism, animal strikes and falling objects, like tree limbs.</p>
